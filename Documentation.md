+First File (oklo_data.py)

++ Implementation of yfinance library
- Integrated.

++ Implementation of streamlit framework
- Integrated.

1. First Page is about analyzing one ticker at a time, view its historical RSI and MACD charts, and check the current indicator values.
2. Second Page is the Options with newly implemented Greeks.
3. Third Page is a email notification/subscription system, where an SMTP Server still needs to be implemented to store data and refresh and to automatically send out a notification when the price drops below a RSI under 35 or hits a RSI over 65.

######
To-Do:

1. Educational Onboarding
* Begin with a “Learn” section or tutorial:
* Basic concepts of trading, differences between asset classes, quick knowledge checks.
* Possibly short videos or interactive slides.

2. Strategy Builder & Simulations
* Provide an interface (“Build”) to pick which assets, define signals (e.g., RSI < 30 => Buy), set day-trade toggles, etc.
* Let them run a backtest on historical or even randomized data.

3. Analysis & Visualization
* Use Charts & Indicators to let User see performance, distribution of returns, drawdowns, etc.
* Possibly incorporate advanced “Math” or risk metrics.
* Offer an “Explore” mode for deeper data inspection.

4. Go Live
* Switch from “paper trading” to real brokerage (if desired).
* Display a Portfolio tab to track open trades, overall P/L, and so on.

5. User Profiling
* (Optional) Let them input risk tolerance, goals, or prior experience.
* Could shape the content or disclaimers for each user.


# Potential Next Steps
1. MVP: Start with the “Learn” module and a simple “Build + Backtest” flow. This will give users immediate value in exploring trading ideas.

2. Incremental Features:
* Add advanced indicators or an AI-driven “strategy advisor.”
* Integrate a brokerage for real trading.
* Expand user profile features for more personalized guidance.


UI Flow:
-Onboarding / Profile Setup
-Learn & Quiz
-Build a Strategy (Indicators, etc.)
-Backtest & Evaluate (Charts, P/L, distribution)
-Option to Paper Trade or Connect Real Broker
